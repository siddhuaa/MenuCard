The Digital Menu Card is a web-based project designed to display a restaurant’s food and beverage offerings in an attractive and user-friendly format. Built using HTML and CSS, this project replaces traditional printed menus with a modern, responsive, and visually appealing digital interface that can be viewed on computers, tablets, and smartphones.

The project focuses on creating a structured and aesthetic design where each food item is neatly categorized (such as Starters, Main Course, Desserts, and Beverages), along with images, prices, and short descriptions. CSS is used extensively to enhance the look and feel of the page, making it interactive and elegant through styling, hover effects, layouts, and typography.

This digital menu card is ideal for restaurants, cafés, and food trucks that want to offer customers a hygienic, paperless, and easily updatable menu option.
